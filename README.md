The idea for this project was that I try to use the Steam API to collect a user's info and compare with another user's info.

# notes

Get your API key from Steam and drop it in a file called devapikey.py at the top level.

## Whats in this?

This app uses:
    - Python3
    - Flask
    - SASS
    - NPM
    - Node.js
    - Twitter Bootstrap 4
    - JQuery
    - pyoidc (Smiley's Steam API for Python - Unofficial)
